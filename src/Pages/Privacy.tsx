                            Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application. They are unique to your account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.

                            Some cookies are associated with your account and Personal Data to remember that you are logged in and which parts of the Service or Website you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access the Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there, but if you disable some or all cookies, you may not be able to use the Services.

                            Exbot sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Exbot and its affiliates. In addition, we use third parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt out of third-party cookies from Google Analytics on its website.

                            We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.
